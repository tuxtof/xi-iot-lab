Nutanix Xi IoT Edge Devices
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The lab environment has been setup to include a Nutanix Cluster running the latest version of Nutanix Acropolis, along with pre-staged Edge machines.

The pre-staged edge devices will be used for part 1 of today's lab, with physical devices used for the part 2.  Physical devices will more closely replicate the type of Edge deployment seen in real world environments.

**Pre-staged Edge Devices**

- **IP Address** - x.x.x.x
- **Serial Nunmbers** - xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

Each lab attendee will be assigned a pre-staged edge device that can be used for part 1 of today's lab.
