Nutanix Xi IoT Edge Devices
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The lab environment has been setup to include a Nutanix Cluster running the latest version of Nutanix Acropolis, along with pre-staged Edge machines.

In additional to the virtual pre-staged Edge devices that will be assigned to each **lab pair**, physical Intel NUC Edge Devices have also provided for each group.  These physical edge devices will be used in part 1 and 2 of today's lab.

**Pre-staged Edge Devices**

Each lab **pair** will be assigned a pre-staged edge device that can be used for part 1 of today's lab.
