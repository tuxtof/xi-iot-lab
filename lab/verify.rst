We can now carry out a test to make sure the FaceFeed app is operating correctly.

1. On your local computer, browse to https://<edge_device_ip_address:8888>
2. Login to the FaceFeed application with the credentials provided by your presenter.
3. Within the FaceFeed application, click **Go To Application**.
4. If all previous steps have been completed and the IP camera is operating correctly, a list of unknown faces will be available, tagged as "Unknown"

Since no faces are currently registered, all faces will be unknown.

5. Click the **Go to registration portal** link.
6. Using the **Camera** option, take a photo of yourself or of someone in your group.
7. Complete the form and click **Add to Database**.
8. Wait until the person's name shows in the list of registered faces, then ask that person (nicely!) to look at the lens of the IP camera.

If everything is operating as expected, the person's face will be recognised and shown in the list with appropriate details.
